# Sugarscape : Simplified implementation of the Sugarscape system
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarscape
#
# Description :
# - Sugarscape is based on 1 vegetal agent and 2-state animal agents
# - 'grass' agents grow by germination every 3 time steps
# - 'sheep' agents start with 40 'grass' points and loose 1 point per time step
# - 'sheep' agents have random movements as long as they are not 'hungry'
# - 'hungry' agents move on neighboring cell with maximal 'grass' field
# - 'hungry' agents absorb all 'grass' agents they met
# - 'hungry' agents go back to 'sheep' state when they absorbed enough 'grass'

world 32 32 FFF            # use a 32x32 grid and white color for void cells

vegetal grass 0C0          # use green color for 'grass' agents
var grass 5                # each 'grass' agent contains 5 grass units
field grass -1             # 'grass' field broadcasts up to distance 5
status grass < 1 void      # 'grass' agent disapears when eated by a 'sheep'
var seed 3 -1              # 'grass' germination requires 3 time steps
birth seed < 1 grass       # germination when seed < 1

animal sheep FF5           # use beige color for 'sheep' agents
var grass 40 -1            # sheep starts with 40 initial 'grass' points
status grass < 25 hungry   # sheep becomes hungry when 'grass' < 25Z

animal hungry F50          # use orange color for 'hungry' agents
var grass grass -1         # keep previous value of 'grass' variable
var smell                  # shorcut for "var smell 0 0"
sensor smell grass 1       # hungry sheep tries to find grass
status grass < 1 void      # hungry dies when 'grass' < 1
status grass > 40 sheep    # back to 'sheep' state when 'grass' > 40
